<h2>Story of a Paralyzed Man</h2>
This month we will be talking about the <b>Miracles of Jesus</b> and today we are going to talk about <b>Why we need good friends </b>
<b>(raise your hand)</b> How many of you have a very good friend? Can you tell me why you like them? 
Jesus was hanging out with his friends. They had dinner and they all wanted to hear him speak. 
The house was so full that there was not place to stand. Not even outside the door. 
(show <b>Picture 1</b>) 
While Jesus was teaching, some people brought a paralyzed man to see him
<b>(raise your hands)</b> How many of you know what <b>paralyzed</b> means? <i> Someone who cannot walk. </i>
(show <b>Picture 2</b>)
He was being carried by four of his friends. But the house was full and there was no way to enter the house and see Jesus. 
<b>(raise your hands) </b>What do you think they should do?
While Jesus was talking suddenly something started falling from the roof. 
Someone was removing the shingles on roof. Everyone was starled. What was going on?
These men made a hole on the roof above Jesus and they lowered the mat with the paralyzed man. 
(show <b>Picture 3</b>) 
(show <b>Picture 4</b>) 
When Jesus saw how much faith these men had, he said to the paralyzed man, "your sins are forgiven" 
When the Pharisee's head this they were shocked. They did not believe that Jesus was son of God
(show <b>Picture 5</b>) 
Jesus always saw people's hearts. He wanted to show them that he was son of God and he can heal this cripled man
Jesus looked at that man and said "Stand up. Take your man and walk"
Immediately the paralyzed man stood up. Picked up his mat and walked out of the room. 
(show <b>Picture 6</b>) 
Everyone was amazed and they had never seen anything like this.
<b>(raise your hands) </b>What do we learn from this true story?
Jesus was amazed at this paralyzed man's friends who did not give up
It was their faith that helped him to get well
So choose our friends wisely
