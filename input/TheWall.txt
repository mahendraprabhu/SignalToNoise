Once upon a long ago, there was a powerful king who ruled Persia. 
The king had a very important man to protect him. His name was Nehemiah.
Nehemia's job was to <b>taste</b> king's food. <b>(Raise your hand)</b> How many of you like to have the job to taste food? I would. 
One day Nehemiah was <b>sad</b> when he heard that his parent's city was in ruins. Walls broken. Gates destroyed.
Do you know what he did? He <b>prayed</b>. The king saw that Nehemiah was sad and he was moved and he sent Nehemiah to rebuild the city. 
How do you think Nehemiah would have felt? <b>Happy </b>. He went to Jerusalem. 
<b> Turn off lights </b> When it was dark, he went to check the walls of the city. The walls were destroyed. 
The next day he called the people and said <b>"lets rebuild our city"</b>. People were inspired. 
Nehemiah told each family to build the wall closer to their house. 
What is a story if we dont have villans ... in this story, there were three <b>Grumpy Guys </b> who did not want walls to be fixed.
The grumpy guys made fun of the people who were building the wall.
Nehemiah did not respond to them, instead he <b>prayed</b>.
Grumpy guys were not happy. They planned to fight the city. What do you think Nehemiah did. He <b>prayed</b>. 
The people became afraid of the grumpy guys. Nehemiah reminded them that <b>Our God is on our side</b>. 
Nehemiah put guards around the workers while they worked in the nights. They worked hard. God was with them. 
Guess what, they completed the walls in <b>52</b> days.
Everybody was happy and felt safe. Nehemiah stayed in Jerusalem and helped people to love God.
God always proptects us when we love him. Because God loves us very much.
